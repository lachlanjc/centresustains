The **#BuildforCOVID19** Global Online Hackathon was an opportunity for global developers to come together and tackle challenges related to the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic.

Innovators around the world were encouraged to use technologies of their choice across a range of suggested themes and challenge areasâ€”some sourced through health partners including the World Health Organization and scientists from the Chan Zuckerberg Biohub.

The hackathon welcomed locally and globally focused software solutions, with support from technology companies and platforms including AWS, Facebook, Giphy, Microsoft, Pinterest, Salesforce, Slack, TikTok, Twitter and WeChat, who shared resources to support participants throughout the submission period.
