Across Centre Region, our annual greenhouse gas emissions are
**824,209&nbsp;metric tons CO₂e**.
Our emissions per person are **more than 2x the global average**,
though fairly average for U.S. suburban areas.

This calculation only includes carbon emitted locally, not individuals’ total footprints,
so the carbon impact of products purchased, shipments, flights, etc are not included.
