## Take the survey <ClipboardCheck />

Later this month, we’re running a survey for 6 weeks on Centre County’s climate adaptation plans.
We’d love to have you weigh in—whether you live here, work in the area, go to Penn&nbsp;State or State&nbsp;High, we want to hear your opinion.

<Signup />

After the survey, in April 2021 we will be running a public forum event to discuss:

<Link href="/forum" passHref>
  <Button as="a" bg="brown">
    <CalendarEvent />
    Attend the forum →
