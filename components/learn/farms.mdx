All crop and livestock producers should prepare for new or more aggressive weeds as well as pest and disease outbreaks due to the warmer and wetter conditions.

With a focus on healthy soils, farming is part of the solution since agriculture farmland can serve as “sinks” to capture and store excess atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).

Agriculture is a significant component of Centre County’s economy, with $94.5 million in annual farm gate sales (NASS, 2019).

Farms can be managed in a way creating multiple benefits beyond production. Locally, check out the [Slab Cabin Run Initiative](https://www.centredaily.com/news/local/article229681529.html), a collaboration between Clearwater Conservancy, the Meyer family, and local governments.
A resulting multi-acre [riparian buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riparian_buffer) serves multiple ecological functions:
reducing nitrogen, phosphorus, and stormwater sediment while providing improved habitat, eventual shade for the stream, and carbon sequestration.
