- Farms are part of the solution using sustainable farming practices (like using less fertilizers)
- A lot of our fields are green because we're already doing these to increase healthy soils
- Farmers need to be prepared for the evolving impacts: heavy rain + long droughts
  - Growing season is changing, dairy cows will be less productive as productivity moves North, chickens will be increasing here

Agricultural lands make us 26% of the land use in the Centre Region. With regenerative agriculture, farmland can serve as “sinks” to capture and store excess atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).

Climate change and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations may have several large direct impacts on livestock yields and production costs in Pennsylvania. Agriculture is a significant component of Centre County’s economy, with $94.5 million in annual farm gate sales (NASS, 2019).

Non-agricultural development has 66x more GHG emissions than farms.

Farms can be managed in such a way that they create multiple benefits beyond production. Locally, we can see this happening with the Slab Cabin Run Initiative, a collaboration between Clearwater Conservancy, the Meyer family, and local governments and authorities. This collaboration has resulted in a multi-acre riparian buffer that serves multiple ecological functions: reduce nitrogen, phosphorus, and sediment from stormwater while providing improved habitat, eventual shade for the stream, and a small amount of carbon sequestration.

Climate solutions that enhance land-based sinks cluster around waste and diets, ecosystem protection and restoration, improved agriculture practices, and prudent use of degraded land.
