Farms are seeing an increase in springtime **flooding**, delaying planting & reducing yield.
More frequent & intense summer **heat waves** can have direct impacts on crop and livestock yields and production costs.

Agriculture is a significant component of Centre Countyâ€™s economy,
with [$91.5 million in annual farm sales](https://centrecountypa.gov/209/Agriculture).
Best management practices need to ensure our farms are prepared and able to adapt to a changing climate.

- Climate change may have several large direct impacts on [livestock yields and production costs in Pennsylvania](http://files.dep.state.pa.us/Energy/Office%20of%20Energy%20and%20Technology/OETDPortalFiles/ClimateChange/2020ClimateChangeImpactsAssessmentUpdate.pdf). Some of these impacts include changes in on-farm feed grain yields and quality; prices of purchased feeds; heat stress on livestock and changes in heating, cooling, and ventilation costs.
- Farmers should [prepare for new or more aggressive weeds as well as pest and disease outbreaks](https://iee.psu.edu/climate-impacts/ag) due to the warmer and wetter conditions.

[Regenerative agriculture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regenerative_agriculture) is a solution to increase resilience to climate change by strengthening the health and vitality of farm soil. Healthy soils play a significant role in reversing climate change by naturally absorbing carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).

Farms can be managed in a way creating multiple benefits beyond production. Locally, check out the [Slab Cabin Run Initiative](https://www.centredaily.com/news/local/article229681529.html), a collaboration between Clearwater Conservancy, the Meyer family, and local governments.
A resulting multi-acre [riparian buffer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riparian_buffer) serves multiple ecological functions:
reducing nitrogen, phosphorus, and stormwater sediment while providing improved habitat, eventual shade for the stream, and carbon sequestration.
