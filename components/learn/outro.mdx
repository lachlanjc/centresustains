Preparing for and managing climate change-related risks goes beyond local government
and will require collective action from across our community.
The Centre Region will lead efforts to make sure our community anticipates
and responds to climate change impacts.
[As others across our state are doing](https://www.dep.pa.gov/Citizens/climate/Pages/Local-Climate-Action.aspx#:~:text=The%20DEP%20Energy%20Programs%20Office,participating%20in%20LCAP%202020%2D2021.),
we are developing a [climate action plan](https://www.crcog.net/climateaction)
for our region and your input will help guide decisions and priorities.
