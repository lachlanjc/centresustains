Preparing for and managing climate change-related risks goes beyond local government
and will require **collective action** across our community.
The Centre Region will lead efforts to make sure our community anticipates
and responds to these effects.

[As others across our state are doing](https://www.dep.pa.gov/Citizens/climate/Pages/Local-Climate-Action.aspx#:~:text=The%20DEP%20Energy%20Programs%20Office,participating%20in%20LCAP%202020%2D2021.),
we are developing a [climate&nbsp;action plan](https://www.crcog.net/climateaction)
for our region and your input will help guide our decisions & priorities.
