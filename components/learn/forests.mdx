Climate change is increasing the vulnerability of many forests to ecosystem changes and tree mortality through **fire, insect infestations, drought, and disease** outbreaks.

Interacting stressors such as insect pests, pathogens, and climate change are affecting native trees and plants, animals, and rare & endangered species. We are seeing changing forest composition, loss of tree species, changes in insect and disease pressures, and increasing invasive plants & animals.

49% of Centre Region land is forest, and properly managed forests can be a part of the climate solution by absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).

Centre County’s rate of <Bug /> Lyme Disease has **grown 7x** in the last decade <Plus />

PA incidence of Lyme Disease has tripled in the last 10 years.
Centre County is double that—our rates have increased 6.7x in that decade.

Warmer temperatures have led to an earlier larval peak of the blacklegged (deer) tick, the major Lyme disease transmitter.
The number, distribution, and length of time during the year that ticks and mosquitoes are active have all been increasing,
thereby increasing the public's exposure to vector borne diseases such as Lyme Disease.

Invasive species can take advantage of changing temps and could expand their range.
Private and public land owners will need to plant climate change-resilient trees to replace those we lose.

[40% of Pennsylvania’s 227 bird species](https://www.dcnr.pa.gov/GoodNatured/pages/Article.aspx?post=83)
are vulnerable to climate change according to the Audubon Society of PA.

<Tree />

Forest ecosystems absorb and sequester a significant portion of our carbon emissions, but that capability is influenced by land management activities, forest health, tree productivity, and the ability of forests to adapt to climate change.
The Centre Region established a Regional Growth Boundary (RGB) in 2000 as the area within which most future growth is anticipated to occur.
