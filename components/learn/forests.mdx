Climate change is increasing the vulnerability of forests to **fire, insect infestations, drought, and disease** outbreaks.

Interacting stressors such as insect pests, pathogens, and climate change are affecting native trees and plants, animals, and rare & endangered species. We are seeing changing forest composition, loss of tree species, changes in insect and disease pressures, and increasing invasive plants & animals.

49% of Centre Region land is forest, and properly managed forests can be a part of the climate solution by absorbing atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub>.

Centre County’s rate of <Bug /> Lyme Disease has **grown&nbsp;7x** in the last decade <Plus />

PA incidence of Lyme Disease has tripled in the last 10 years.
Centre County is double that—our rates have increased 6.7x in that decade.

Warmer temperatures have led to an earlier larval peak of the blacklegged (deer) tick, the major Lyme disease transmitter.
The number, distribution, and length of time during the year that ticks and mosquitoes are active have all been increasing,
thereby increasing the public’s exposure to vector borne diseases such as Lyme Disease.

Invasive species can take advantage of changing temperatures and could expand their range.
Private and public land owners will need to

are vulnerable to climate change according to the Audubon Society of PA.

In 2000, the Centre Region established a
[Regional Growth Boundary (RGB)](https://www.crcog.net/index.asp?SEC=01E465F4-F50A-421B-BD1A-D5F9CA1507C3&DE=7DE271CE-517E-4B3A-9F91-917C993D4217)
which has allowed 80% of our region to remain undeveloped.
The objective of the RGB is to protect and preserve open spaces,
farmland and natural environments from random urban and suburban
development on the outskirts of the urban center.
