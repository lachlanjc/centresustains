49% of the land in the Centre Region consists of forest and properly managed forests can be a part of the climate solution by absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2).

We need to protect our forests and prepare for the effects of climate change, such as changing forest composition, loss of tree species, changes in insect and disease pressures, and invasive plants and animals.

Forty percent of Pennsylvaniaâ€™s 227 bird species are vulnerable to climate change according to the Audubon Society of PA.
Invasive species can take advantage of changing temps and could expand their range.
Private and public land owners will need to plant climate change-resilient trees to replace those we lose.
