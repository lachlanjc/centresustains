The Pennsylvania Auditor General [reported that in 2018](https://www.paauditor.gov/Media/Default/Reports/RPT_Climate_crisis_111219_FINAL.pdf) climate-related costs to Pennsylvania totaled at least $261 million;
that number includes record-breaking floods and landslides that caused more than $125.7 million in infrastructure damages.

During the rainstorm [in October 2016, 7-10” of rain fell](http://www.bennertownship.org/?page_id=1014) over the course of 4 hours in Centre County that damaged several bridges and roadways.
This event caused a landslide along Purdue Mountain Road in Benner Township which **closed the road for almost 2 years**.
FEMA and PEMA covered 65% of the $933,000 needed for repairs.

We will be increasingly forced to divert funding to climate-caused infrastructure damages.
