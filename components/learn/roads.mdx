Flooding, related to extreme precipitation events, present significant and growing risks to the safety, reliability, effectiveness, and sustainability of roads across Centre County.

The Pennsylvania Auditor General reported that in 2018 climate-related costs to Pennsylvania totaled at least $261 million; that number includes record-breaking floods and landslides that caused more than $125.7 million in infrastructure damages.2

During the rainstorm in October 2016, 7-10” of rain fell over the course of 4 hours in Centre County that damaged several bridges and roadways. This event caused a landslide along Purdue Mountain Road in Benner Township which closed the road for almost 2 years. FEMA and PEMA covered 65% of the $933,000 needed for repairs.

Flooding (related either to extreme precipitation or coastal storm surge in Southeastern Pennsylvania in particular) appears to have the most potential future impact on infrastructure systems in Pennsylvania. 6

LOCAL RESILIENCY ACTIONS: The Centre County Metropolitan Planning Organization (CCMPO) has several projects underway to address transportation infrastructure that is failing due to extreme rain events. It also includes a resiliency section (page 126 – 131) in the latest Long-Range Transportation Plan (LRTP) with intent to track and identify at-risk transportation-related assets (page 180).
