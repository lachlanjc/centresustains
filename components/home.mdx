We’re <Link href="/about">[a group of elected officials](/about)</Link>
in Centre County working with local scientists, engineers, & urban planners
on pragmatic, fiscally responsible environmental stewardship.

We’re currently creating a [Climate Action & Adaption Plan](https://www.crcog.net/climateaction) for the six municipalities to adopt. The goal is to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions, as well as adapt to our ever-changing climate.

The plan will be available for public review in late summer, with requests for open feedback in the early fall. Then the fun begins: putting the strategies into action!

## Local climate change <JournalAlbum />

While other areas see sea level rise & wildfires, in central PA,
drastic changes to our **forests, weather, roads, & agriculture** are underway.
We’ve made an inventory of carbon emissions &
assembled a primer on local climate change impacts.
