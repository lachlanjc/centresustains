We’re <Link href="/about">[a group of elected officials](/about)</Link>
in Centre County working with local scientists, engineers, & urban planners
on pragmatic, fiscally responsible environmental stewardship.

We’ve most recently been drafting a [Climate Action & Adaption Plan](https://www.crcog.net/caap). The CAAP provides a framework for the community to begin reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, as well as adapt to our ever-changing climate. It will serve as a guide for governmental entities, residents, businesses, and community organizations to take an active part in the transition to a low-carbon future, prepare for the impacts of climate change, and create a healthier and more prosperous community.

The hope then is for the 32 elected officials (General Forum) of State College Borough and College, Ferguson, Halfmoon, Harris, and Patton Townships to consider adopting the CAAP at its November 22, 2021 meeting.

## Local climate change <JournalAlbum />

While other areas see sea level rise & wildfires, in central PA,
drastic changes to our **forests, weather, roads, & agriculture** are underway.
We’ve made an inventory of carbon emissions &
assembled a primer on local climate change impacts.
