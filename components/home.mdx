## Take the survey <ClipboardCheck />

Starting February 1, we’re running a survey for 8 weeks on Centre County’s climate adaptation plans.
We’d love to have you weigh in—whether you live here, work in the area, go to Penn&nbsp;State or State&nbsp;High, we want to hear your opinion.

## Public forum <ChatQuote />

After the survey, in April 2021 we will be running a public forum event
with elected officials, local residents, & business owners to discuss our plans.
