Centre Sustains wants to engage the community to cultivate literacy about climate risks and responses to generate a shared understanding and commitment to actions that will sustain our community’s economic, environmental and social well-being.

## Take the survey <ClipboardCheck />

Starting February 1, we’re running a survey for 8 weeks on Centre County’s climate adaptation plans.
We’d love to have you weigh in—whether you live here, work in the area, go to Penn&nbsp;State or State&nbsp;High, we want to hear your opinion.

## Public forum <ChatQuote />

After the survey, in April 2021 we will be running a public forum event
with elected officials, local residents, & business owners to discuss our plans.
