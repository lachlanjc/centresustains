We’re a group of elected officials in Centre County working with local scientists & urban planners toward environmental stewardship,
prudent fiscal accountability, and inclusive local government and community practices.

Local government recognizes the substantial consequences that climate change poses to our local environment, public health, economy and lifestyles. The Centre Region COG is determined to identify, address, and to the degree possible, prevent the negative impacts of climate change.

## Council of Governments

In Centre County, elected officials from the municipalities of Patton, College, Harris, Ferguson, Halfmoon, & the State College Borough
collaborate through the [Centre Region Council of Governments](https://www.crcog.net/).
