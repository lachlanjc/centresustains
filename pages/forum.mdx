Penn State Law students facilitated small group conversations based around these questions:

<Timeline>
  <TimelineStep
    name="What do you see as existing or potential climate impacts in the Centre County region?"
    color="pink"
  />
  <TimelineStep
    name="What opportunities do you see in addressing or adapting to these impacts?"
    color="red"
  />
  <TimelineStep
    name="What actions would you like see in this region, and what actions do you want to see your local governmental officials take?"
    color="brown"
  />
  <TimelineStep
    name="What three messages do you want your facilitators to report back to the broader group involved in this forum?"
    color="yellow"
  />
</Timeline>

During the forum, participants shared their perspectives on the issues or
challenges they saw affecting this region. They also shared their vision for
potential action they wanted to see local governments take.
