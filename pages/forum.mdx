# Forum

## April 2021, we’re holding an open forum on Zoom for community members to help inform our climate planning & strategies.

<Signup />

## <Text color="green">Learn</Text> about climate change in our area,<br /><Text color="brown">discuss</Text>&nbsp;local government’s plans.

We will convene a forum on understanding and managing climate-related risks facing our community so that we are able to increase our resilience. The purpose of this forum is to bring people together to identify issues, think about what the future might look like for Central Pennsylvania, and find common ground solutions.

This initial forum will help set the stage for promoting policies and practices that improve our community, lessen human impacts on the environment, strengthen local economies, and engage community members.

### All are welcome to attend
