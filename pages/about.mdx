## Centre Sustains

Centre&nbsp;Sustains is an effort inside the Council of Governments (COG) to facilitate community conversations about sustainability & climate planning.

COG is developing a plan in 2021 that will include strategies to reduce emissions and make our community more resilient.

Pam Adams, the COG Sustainability Planner, is coordinating the effort.
She is supported by the Technical Advisory Group (TAG),
which provides technical expertise to the General Forum, the policy body of elected officials.
