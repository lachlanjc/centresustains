# <SuitSpade /> Colophon

This site was created December 2020–January 2021 in <GeoAlt />State College, PA
over numerous <CameraVideo /> Zoom calls.

It was conceived, designed, & built by <Person src="/lachlanjc.jpg" alt="Lachlan Campbell" /> [Lachlan Campbell]
in collaboration with <Person src="/tag/pam_adams.jpg" alt="Pam Adams" /> Pam&nbsp;Adams,
the COG Sustainability Planner, who provided writing, research, & guidance.
Thanks to Betsy Whitman for initiating the connection.

The local <Camera /> photography was captured & edited by [Christopher Campbell].

The site is hosted on [<Vercel /> Vercel][vercel] & uses [<GraphUp /> Fathom Analytics][fathom].<br />
It runs on [<Lightning /> Next.js][next.js] with [MDX] & [Theme UI].

The fonts are ITC Clearface (for headings) & Fakt Soft (for body
text). The icons are from <Bootstrap /> [Bootstrap Icons].

The code is fully [open source] on <Github /> GitHub, under the MIT license.

& thanks for visiting! We appreciate it.
