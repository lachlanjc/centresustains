# <SuitSpade /> Colophon

This site was created December 2020–January 2021 in <GeoAlt />State College, PA
over numerous <CameraVideo /> Zoom calls.

It was conceived, designed, & built by <Person src="/lachlanjc.jpg" alt="Lachlan Campbell" /> [Lachlan Campbell]
in collaboration with <Person src="/tag/pam_adams.jpg" alt="Pam Adams" /> Pam&nbsp;Adams,
the COG Sustainability Planner, who provided writing, research, & guidance.
Thanks to Betsy Whitman for initiating the connection.

The local photography was captured & edited by [Christopher Campbell].

The site is powered by [Next.js] with [MDX] & [Theme UI].<br />
It’s hosted on [Vercel] & uses [Fathom Analytics].

The code is fully [open source] on GitHub, under the MIT license.

& thanks for visiting! We appreciate it.
