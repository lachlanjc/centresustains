## Resources for learning about solar in central Pennsylvania & finding local solar installers.

The Centre Region is working to improve solar market conditions, making it faster, easier, and more affordable for our residents and businesses to install solar energy systems. These efforts will also increase the efficiency of local processes related to solar development, which may save our local government time and money.
